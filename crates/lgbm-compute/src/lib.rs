//! `lgbm-compute` — the single CubeCL isolation seam (CMP-01).
//!
//! This crate exists to confine all `cubecl` type names and API churn to one
//! place so the alpha-stage CubeCL surface can evolve without leaking into
//! `lgbm-core` or any other crate. Phase 4 fills the Phase-1 kernel-free
//! skeleton with the compute foundation: a typed [`ComputeError`] boundary, a
//! cpu/rocm runtime selection + startup capability gate ([`runtime`]), and the
//! first `#[cube]` histogram kernel ([`kernels`]).
//!
//! Downstream crates should depend only on the [`Backend`] abstraction (and the
//! re-exported [`ComputeError`]), never on `cubecl` directly — that is the whole
//! point of the seam, and the `cmp01_containment` guard test enforces it.
